**ASTUce**

ASTUce stand for "ActionScript Test Unit compact edition".<br>
ASTUce is a regression testing framework inspired by the xUnit architecture.<br>
<br>
This framework is intended for developers who wish to implement unit tests in ActionScript3.<br>
<br>
Ideally the framework will be usable in any other ES4 implementation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Philosophy</h1>

We believe in<br>
<ul><li>unit tests that run as fast as possible<br>
</li><li>mock objects to emulate events etc. (or any async stuff)</li></ul>

because of that asyncronous tests have not been implemented,<br>
ASTUce is syncronous only.<br>
<br>
We think<br>
<ul><li>GUI for unit tests sucks and we intend to change that</li></ul>
